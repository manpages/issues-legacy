I've got this great idea for issues to be capable of referencing lines of code in files
in particular commits. So that we could have an issue looking like


```
remove bolierplate
---
&[Boilerplate in issue script code](/issue#122-125)
```

And when we run ``issues view id`` it will be expanded to something like


```
remove boilerplate
---

    Boilerplate in issue script code (file: /issue; git head: c23f9a)
    
    122   # wow how hardcode much boilerplate                             
    123   [ -d .issues/open/$path ] && view_do open/$path $* && ok        
    124   [ -d .issues/resolved/$path ] && view_do resolved/$path $* && ok
    125   [ -d .issues/wontfix/$path ] && view_do wontfix/$path $* && ok  

```

Would be cool, wouldn't it?
