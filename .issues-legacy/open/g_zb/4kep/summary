On the second thought, it's not *that* cool in the long run, if we don't expand this context
as we type the issue. The reason is that the line numbers will most certainly change fast
and people who will look at the issue, say, next morning won't be able to see the correct
context (that the author of the issue had in mind). I'll implement this anyway, but we must
address this concern.
